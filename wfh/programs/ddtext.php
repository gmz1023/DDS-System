<section><h1>About the DDS System</h1>
<p>The DDS (Distributed Deployment System) was designed by Dr. Stephen E. Gist and several of his students in [year]. The purpose of the system is to allow you, the consumer, to pick and choose which aspects and features of the personal artificial intelligence are released into the final product. This will allow the consumer to customize the product to their particular needs and desires by choosing different options. </P>

	<h1>COEUS and YOU</h1>
	<p>As a beta tester, you are responsible for providing feedback on any updates and new functionality that the Artificial Intelligence has brought to the table. The top priority is to avoid any undesirable functionality that the AI may have added while also providing feedback on how it performs in comparison to previous versions. There's no way to know what'll happen if you choose one pathway over another, but user feedback has been invaluable in testing these upgrades.
	</p>
	<p>For every new update that is released, a majority vote will be required for its activation; this is to ensure that the most popular features are added to the final product.</p>
	<p>If for whatever reason a feature is added breaks the system, a fail safe "Restart Start" option is available, however requires a majority vote as well. </p>
	<p>As it currently stands this project is in a closed beta -- if you see any issues with the system, please reach out to our <a href='mailto:support@aslo.tech'>support team</a>. If </p>
